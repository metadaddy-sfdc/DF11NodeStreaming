This is the code from my Dreamforce 2011 session: 'Event-Driven Programming 
with Node.js and the Force.com Streaming API'.

Prerequisites
-------------

node modules: express, request (install them with npm)

Aashay Desai's tweaked Faye: https://github.com/aashay/faye - build it 
according to the instructions, create a directory DF11NodeStreaming/node/faye, 
then drop the contents of the faye/build directory in the new faye 
subdirectory.
